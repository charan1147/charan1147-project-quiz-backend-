About-
This is the backend for a quiz application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js). 
It integrates with an external API to fetch quiz questions and uses Socket.IO for real-time quiz interactions. 
The backend handles user authentication, quiz management, and real-time communication for live quiz sessions.

=>Features
-User Authentication: Secure signup, login, and logout using JWT and bcrypt.
-Quiz Management: Fetches questions from an external API and stores user quiz results.
-Real-Time Interaction: Supports live quiz sessions and score updates via Socket.IO.
-RESTful API: Endpoints for user profiles, quiz history, and question retrieval.
-Environment Configuration: Uses dotenv for managing environment variables.
-Logging: HTTP request logging with morgan for debugging.
-CORS Support: Enables cross-origin requests for frontend integration.
